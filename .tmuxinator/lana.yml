# Runs before everything. Use it to start daemons etc.
# pre: sudo /etc/rc.d/mysqld start

# Runs in each window and pane before window/pane specific commands. Useful for setting up interpreter versions.
# pre_window: rbenv shell 2.0.0-p247

# Pass command line options to tmux. Useful for specifying a different tmux.conf.
# tmux_options: -f ~/.tmux.mac.conf

# Change the command to call tmux.  This can be used by derivatives/wrappers like byobu.
# tmux_command: byobu

#preset layouts are:

# even-horizontal
#              Panes are spread out evenly from left to right across the window.

#      even-vertical
#              Panes are spread evenly from top to bottom.

#      main-horizontal
#              A large (main) pane is shown at the top of the window and the
#              remaining panes are spread from left to right in the leftover
#              space at the bottom.  Use the main-pane-height window option to
#              specify the height of the top pane.

#      main-vertical
#              Similar to main-horizontal but the large pane is placed on the
#              left and the others spread from top to bottom along the right.
#              See the main-pane-width window option.

#      tiled   Panes are spread out as evenly as possible over the window in
#              both rows and columns.
